When chunking unstructured data in Python while ignoring redacted data, you'll want to identify and skip any content that appears to be redacted (often shown as blacked-out text, [REDACTED], or similar markers). Here's a structured approach to handle this:

### Approach:
1. **Identify Redacted Content**: Define patterns that indicate redacted data (e.g., `[REDACTED]`, `****`, black rectangles in PDFs, etc.).
2. **Preprocess Data**: Remove or skip redacted content before chunking.
3. **Chunk Clean Data**: Use a standard chunking method (e.g., by sentences, paragraphs, or fixed size) on the filtered data.

### Example Code:
```python
import re
from typing import List, Optional

def is_redacted(text: str, redaction_patterns: List[str]) -> bool:
    """Check if the text contains any redaction markers."""
    for pattern in redaction_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE):
            return True
    return False

def chunk_unstructured_data(
    text: str,
    redaction_patterns: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    chunk_size: int = 1000,
    overlap: int = 200,
) -> List[str]:
    """
    Chunk unstructured text while ignoring redacted parts.
    
    Args:
        text: Input text to chunk.
        redaction_patterns: List of regex patterns for redaction markers.
                          Default: Common patterns like [REDACTED], XXXXX, etc.
        chunk_size: Maximum size of each chunk (in characters).
        overlap: Overlap between chunks (in characters).
    
    Returns:
        List of cleaned chunks.
    """
    if redaction_patterns is None:
        redaction_patterns = [
            r"\[REDACTED\]",    # [REDACTED]
            r"\*{3,}",          # *** or ****
            r"XXXX+",           # XXXX or XXXXX
            r"\[BLACKED_OUT\]", # [BLACKED_OUT]
        ]
    
    # Split into lines or sentences and filter out redacted parts
    lines = text.split('\n')
    cleaned_lines = [
        line.strip() for line in lines 
        if line.strip() and not is_redacted(line, redaction_patterns)
    ]
    cleaned_text = ' '.join(cleaned_lines)
    
    # Simple fixed-size chunking (you can replace with NLP-based chunking)
    chunks = []
    start = 0
    while start < len(cleaned_text):
        end = start + chunk_size
        chunk = cleaned_text[start:end]
        chunks.append(chunk)
        start = end - overlap  # Apply overlap
    
    return chunks

# Example Usage
text = """
This is a normal sentence. 
[REDACTED] 
Another valid sentence here. 
XXXXX 
More text to chunk.
"""

chunks = chunk_unstructured_data(text)
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    print(f"Chunk {i + 1}: {chunk}\n")
```

### Output:
```
Chunk 1: This is a normal sentence. Another valid sentence here. More text to chunk.
```

### Key Notes:
1. **Redaction Patterns**: Customize `redaction_patterns` to match your data (e.g., `r"\[CLASSIFIED\]"`).
2. **Chunking Logic**: The example uses fixed-size chunking. For better results, consider NLP libraries like `spaCy` or `nltk` for sentence/paragraph splitting.
3. **PDFs/Images**: If working with PDFs, use `PyMuPDF` or `pdfplumber` to extract text first. For scanned redactions (black rectangles), you may need OCR + computer vision (e.g., `OpenCV`).
4. **Performance**: For large datasets, pre-filtering redacted content reduces chunking overhead.

Let me know if you'd like to adapt this for a specific use case (e.g., PDFs, OCR output, etc.)!
